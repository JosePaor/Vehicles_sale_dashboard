# Vehicles sale dashboard

This project provides a dashboard for analyzing vehicle sale advertisements. It includes visualizations such as histograms and dispersion plots to explore the dataset.

Here’s a description of the functionalities of the vehicle sales dashboard:

Histogram:
By selecting the “Build a histogram” option, a bar chart will be generated showing the distribution of odometer values in the car sale advertisements dataset.
The x-axis represents odometer values (distance traveled by the vehicle).
You can explore how odometer values are distributed in the dataset.

Scatter Plot:
By selecting the “Build a dispersion plot” option, a scatter plot will be created that relates odometer values to vehicle sale prices.
The x-axis represents odometer values, and the y-axis represents prices.
This plot allows you to visualize whether there is any relationship between mileage and selling price for the cars.

You can activate or deactivate these functionalities by clicking on the corresponding checkboxes. Explore the data and have fun analyzing the car sale advertisements! 🚗📊
